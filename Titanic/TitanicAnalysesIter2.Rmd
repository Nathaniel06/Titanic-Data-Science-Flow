Load Data from titanic analyses iter 1

```{r}
library(caret);
library(ggplot2);

train <- read.csv("train.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

summary(model)
confusionMatrix(Xtrain$Survived, model_test)

compare <- data.frame(Model = model_test, Actual = factor(Xtrain$Survived))
```

Split Xtrain into Xtrain_test and Xtrain_train

```{r}
Xtrain_train <- Xtrain[1:(dim(Xtrain)[1]/2),]
Xtrain_test <- Xtrain[(dim(Xtrain)[1]/2 +1):(dim(Xtrain)[1]),]

model1 <- glm(Survived ~ ., data = Xtrain_train, family = binomial)
model_test1 <-factor(ifelse(predict(model1, newdata = Xtrain_test[train_names]) > 0.5,1,0))
summary(model1)
confusionMatrix(Xtrain_test$Survived, model_test1)
```

create new features taking into consideration Age, Sibsb, and Parch
```{r}
summary(all)
```

plot sibsp and parch factored by survived
```{r}
library(gridExtra)
sib <- ggplot(train, aes(SibSp)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", aes(fill = factor(train$Survived)))
parch <- ggplot(train, aes(Parch)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", aes(fill = factor(train$Survived)))
age <- ggplot(train, aes(Age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 40,position = "dodge", aes(fill = factor(train$Survived)))

grid.arrange(sib, parch, age, ncol = 1)

```
Penalty for having no siblings and no parents

create new features for 0 parents and 0 siblings

```{r}
all$factor_SibSP <- factor(as.numeric(all$SibSp == 0))
all$factor_Parch <- factor(as.numeric(all$Parch == 0))
all$factor_single <- factor(as.numeric(all$Parch == 0 & all$SibSp == 0))
all$isbaby <- factor(as.numeric(all$Age < 5))
all$istwenty <- factor(as.numeric(all$Age > 15 & all$Age < 30))
summary(all)
```
Create new train and test with sibsp and parch and implment logistic model

```{r}
train_names <- c("factor_ Pclass", "factor_ Sex", "factor_SibSP", "factor_Parch")
Xtrain <- all[1:891, train_names]
Xtrain$Survived <- factor(train[,"Survived"])
Xtest <- all[892:1309, train_names]

Xtrain_train <- Xtrain[1:(dim(Xtrain)[1]/2),]
Xtrain_test <- Xtrain[(dim(Xtrain)[1]/2 +1):(dim(Xtrain)[1]),]

model1 <- glm(Survived ~ ., data = Xtrain_train, family = binomial)
model_test1 <-factor(ifelse(predict(model1, newdata = Xtrain_test[train_names]) > 0.5,1,0))
summary(model1)
confusionMatrix(Xtrain_test$Survived, model_test1)

compare <- data.frame(Model = model_test1, Actual = factor(Xtrain_test$Survived))
```
create submission for kaggle by running model on test data using the entire train set

```{r}
submission_test_data <- Xtest
submission_test_model <- glm(Survived ~ ., data = Xtrain, family = binomial)
submission_test_predict <-factor(ifelse(predict(submission_test_model, newdata = submission_test_data) > 0.5,1,0))

submission_df <- data.frame("PassengerId" = all[892:1309, "PassengerId"], "Survived" = submission_test_predict)

write.csv(submission_df[c("PassengerId", "Survived")], "Titanic_Submission.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
